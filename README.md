Radio
=====

This repo is a dumping ground for documentation and configs related to amateur radio.

Usage
-----

The `allstar` directory contains scripts and other config files for use on an [Allstar node](https://www.allstarlink.org/). I recommend you create a symlink of any script or config you intend to use on your node, so it's stored in the right place, but also automatically updated whenever you update this repo. Since I always forget and have to look it up, create a symlink with this command:

```
ln -s <absolute path of file in repo> <absolute path of desired location>
```

The `chirp` directory contains disk images used by [Chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Download) to configure your radio. I mostly use Baofeng UV-5Rs so that's all I got right now.
